# Artificial Neural Network in DEVS

## Description
This project uses the Cadmium v2 library to implement a DEVS model of a simple artificial neural network. 

## Installation
Follow the Cadmium V2 installation manual to setup the environment, then clone the repository and run "./build.sh" to create the "main.out" executable in the bin folder. 
If you run the executable with "./bin/main.out" it will run the sample simulation with the input script provided.
the results.csv file stored in the simulation_results folder.
It should follow the following DEVS diagram

## Plans for the Future
-Create Neuron atomic model
-Add loss functions with back propagation
-See if DEVS offers better speeds than usual because of Abstract Simulator offering great parallelization on any standard CPU
